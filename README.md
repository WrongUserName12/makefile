# Simple Makefile Project

This is a simple project that demonstrates the use of a Makefile to compile a C program and perform basic tasks like generating files and cleaning up.

## Files

- `Makefile`: The makefile that contains the rules for building and cleaning the project.
- `main.c`: The C source file that will be compiled into an executable named `main`.

## Makefile Targets

### `main`

This target compiles the `main.c` source file into an executable named `main`.

```sh
$ make
